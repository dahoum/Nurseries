## Organisational Change

We have `Organisational Change` when we change the [Practices](https://github.com/dahoum/Nurseries/tree/master/Practices) of an `Organisation`.

There is a saying, that if you chagne the structure of an organisation, but do not change the culture, the culture will bend the changed structure back, towards its original form.
