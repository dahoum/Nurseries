# Change

“It ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things”

Niccolò Machiavelli (1513) The Prince, Chapter VI

## Organisational Change

We have `Organisational Change` when we change the [Practices](https://github.com/dahoum/Nurseries/tree/master/Practices) of an `Organisation`.

There is a saying, that if you change the structure of an organisation, but do not change the culture, the culture will bend the changed structure back, towards its original form.
