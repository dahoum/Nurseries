## Research & Development Cooperative

### Which Problems Are We Solving?

#### Uncertainty Through Dependency w/o Control

A supplier-customer relationship, even when excellent both contractually and in tems of human relationships, does not solve the problem, that these are two separate legal entities and the customer has zero influence over the general business governance of the supplier.

This creates uncertainty throuh dependency and blocks deeper and longer partnership.

This can be solved through exchange of shares, however this is either too weak or too strong. Too few shares do not give enough control and too many shares are practically a takeover. The interests of other customers are not protected as shareholders have the right of information or he interests of other customers can be overruled, which destroys the value of a broad organisation.

A cooperative form can give participation in the governance through voting rights to the customer, while leaving the cooperative fully independent in pursuing other goals as well.

The broad base of the cooperative, thus, benefits all participants.

A well functioning example is Fraunhofer eV.

#### Knowledge Workers Are The Capital And Deserve A Structural Vote

The premise of this idea is, that running a bodyshop of knowledge workers is not the right way knowledge workers should operate.

The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, pleaded, above all, for a greater involvement of the knowledge workers in the process.

A R & D Cooperative, where the accumulated capital is owned by all cooperative members (see the [Precedence](#precedence) rule), is a more fair approach, than one or a few individuals owning the result of the worl of everybody, because they started the company in the past and this gives them gradually a larger and larger leverage compared to everybody else.

The driving force behind many a revolution in the past has been social injustice through accumulation of wealth and power either through hereditary systems (such as minarchy) or through unhinged capitalism.

The frequently quoted faied socialist experiment in the East wasn't really a socialism. It was a terror driven, criminal organisation, masked as socialism.

The cooperative movement provides a middle way, where, on one hand the personal contribution and iniciative are rewarded, but on another extreme distortions are prevented, which distortions certainly lead to social unjustice, tampering w/ political and military power.

### Vision

A cooperative w/ focus on IT Research and Development.

Members can be individuals and organisations who need Research and Development or who want to work for the cooperative.

Each member has one vote.

The Vision and the cooperative cannot be changed by members voting to change it.

The cooperative is financed by customers who order `IT Research and Development` work.

(Can replicate Fraunhofer, but on another level.)

### Membershup

Members can be

* Customers as long as they have a contract
* Employees
* Subcontractors
* Partners
  * Strategic
  * Cooperation
  * Research

### Ownership

#### Name

The `Cooperative` owns the name.

### Budget

The cooperative has very clear and transparent roles and salary structure, that follows the salary structure of similar establishments (eg. Universities, Fraunhofer, TNO, etc.)

The cooprative has a minimalistic overhead (as minimalistic as possible).

Fixed %s from the overal turnover go into

* PR and sales effort
* Training of the employees
* Idle Fund
* Budget for own Research and Development Projects

#### Salaries

The cooperative pays salaries following the salary structure of similar organisations:

* Universities
* Fraunhofer

##### Salary as Talant Attraction And Retention

The premise, that talent is attracted by pay is wrong.

The most powerful driving force is the possibility to control one's destiny.

By giving employees equal vote (and not only on organisational level, but w/in every sub-organisational level, one grants them the ultimate gift in life.

### Principles

#### Purpose and Quality

The `Purpose` and `Qualaity` are clearly defined and the main guidance.

#### Roles/ Freedom and Flexibility

The `Cooperative` is governed by clearly defined roles w/ clear responsibilities.

#### Initiatives

An `Initiative` is a short, medium or long term projects, which can be initiatied by any Member of the Cooperative.

The Initiatives are the core internal innovation mechanism.

A strict set of rules guarantees, that:

* everyone can start an initiative
* nobody can stop a successful initiative, which abides by the rules of the cooperative

##### Rules Supporting Initiatives

* The pricing, earning and salary structure of the cooperative is such, that every employee has 20% of their working time for personal growth, education, training, development of ideas and launch of initiatives.
* Initiatives born through this 20% rule, can seek internal and external adopters and customers.
* Initiatives, that attract intrnal or external adopters and customers can grow. For example a person w/ idea can attract second or more persons who contribute their 20% budget to the idea.
* Initiatives are subject to the [Precedence](#precedence) rule.

##### Budget

An `Initiative` has own budget. Each `Initiative` has the right of a proportion of the shared internal R&D budget and can attract external budget.

##### Freedom of Design and Leadership of Initiatives

To promote and support initiative, members can design and lead initiatives.

#### Protection and Preservation of Initiatives

The `Cooperative` cannot stop `Initiatives`, which are viable, where viability is defined as earning its own money, or financing its existance through means of support by other cooperative members, reducing one's pay.

### Governance

#### Staying on Course

One of the major fears, when it comes to democratic models (like a democratic country, in fact) is that a bad majority can take the organisation off course.

This is, indeed, a real danger. However it is not a greater danger, than the organisation being take off course, by a small clique at the top.

A democratic process might be slower and might prevent peaks of ingenuinity (which is actually not true, see the section on [Initiatives](#initiatives)), but it leads to greater overall social wealth, which leads to creater overall hapiness.

The same way democratic countries stay on course w/ the help of a constinution, the Cooperative can stay on course w/ the help of clearly defined vision, mission, rukes of governance and KPIs; all described in this document.

#### Challenges and Dangers

##### Founder's Syndrome

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder%27s_syndrome

Founder's syndrome is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project's scope or change policy.

##### Peter's Principle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle

The Peter Principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.

##### Hostile Takeover

...

### Precedence

The Precedence Rule is a key and a complex rule w/ several goals:

* protection of work and ideas of earlier members from hostile takeover by members, who have joined later
* formexample the founders of the cooperative have precedence and the people who have concieved an idea have precedence

The complexity of the Precedence Rule is that it should not create legacy structures, which hinder progress, as these can lead to the death of the creativity and of the organisation altogether.

Thus, the Precedence Rule should only apply to own ideas, should not give blocking power over new ideas and their initiation and realisation. Such Rules are called Balancing Rules.

All new peoposals are given to eimployees, initiatives and partners in order of precedence, who have first right of refusal.

## Examples

### Germany

#### Cooperative of Freelancers

#### Cooperatives

##### Raiffaisen

Umbrella cooperative over 300 000 smaller cooperatives.

##### Fraunhofer

Applied Research

29 000 employees

€2,8b annual turnover

##### DATEV

My research into the cooperative forms of business organisation—especially in the IT industry—has led me to v intersting discoveries. For example DATEV, which is the leading provider of IT services for accountants and lawyers in Germany, is a coopeative—where members can be only accountants and lawyers, employs 8 000 people and has a €1b of annual turnover.
