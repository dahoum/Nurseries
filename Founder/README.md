## Founder's Dilemma

### Forgotten Founder

Another problem that can arise is that of the forgotten founder, a person who participates early on in the formation of an enterprise, but leaves or is ousted before it achieves success, and then returns to claim a legal right to equity, intellectual property, or some other fruits of that success. To avoid this problem, it is advised that the entity "incorporate early and issue shares that are subject to vesting over time".
