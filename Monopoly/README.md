# Monopoly

## Introduction

Monopoly market situations are generally frowned upon.

They sometimes exist and cannot be transformed, but when handled w/ care, they can be good.

For example the government of a country has the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force.

## Customer-Supplier Monopoly in IT

When a customer orders custom made software from a software company, the relationship is near monopoly.

There are many software companies, but the cost to switch a software provider is high.

Besides, it is not always clear if a switch will do better. Or will perpetuate the issues, which are sometimes not with the software provider, but w/ the customer. Or will go worse.

### Solutions

There are several ways to address that.

#### Have More Suppliers

If the customer is a larger organisation, which has more than one piece of software, it might be wise to have more than one supplier. Each supplier has mid- to long-term possibility to prove themselves.

When a new project comes, the supplier w/ the best value for money can be selected to take it.

If one of the suppliers does not deliver, replacing it w/ a supplier, which is already in a relationship w/ the organisation and has proven itself over mid- to long-term is far easier, than w/ a completely unkown supplier.
