# Sell

SELL ME THIS PEN Read a list of 10 points on how to sell to a CEO. None of these included preparation. Besides the fact that I personally feel overloaded by such lists, my approach to selling is 99.999% preparation and 0.001% selling. The 99,999% are spent on a long and awkward period of non-verbal and purposless courtship that might be best compared to the courtship in animals doing weird and illogical stuff seemingly w/o a clear purpose. My answer to SELL ME THIS PEN is walk in and silently place it on their desk. If they do not buy it, I have failed. If I cannot sell w/in seconds, I fly away. I find it personally much easier to find someone ready to mate w/ me, than to wait for someone to get ready or even worseâ€”to talk them into it.
