The term "maturity" relates to the degree of formality and optimization of processes, from ad hoc practices, to formally defined steps, to managed result metrics, to active optimization of the processes.

## Maturity and Management

Maturity of a person, crew, process or (digital) product is an important indicator when a decision related to ther management is taken.

Applying a fully matured process onto an immature (but passionate, capable and focused—thus—successful) crew, can in some cases lead to loss of motivaton and should be done w/ care.

People, who believe in certain level of maturity of processes, and who are eager to apply them, w/o regard as to the maturity of the subject or object, could cause losses and should be observed and advised.
