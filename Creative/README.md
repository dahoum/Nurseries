# Creative

## Process

I am not Paul McCartney, but I found oit he has exactly the same attitude towards his own work as the one I have. When I create, alone or as part of a crew, a moment comes, when I look at the creation and say to myself: "tThis thing has been done by some v cool people!" This is, because the creative process accumulates and eventually the result surpasses the nominal creativity of those, who create.
