# Duolingo

_Or how to have fun while learning a language._

I've read so many articles explaining how Duolingo is not _enough_ to master a language, that I felt I should contravene.

Duolingo is, _of course_, not enough to master a language.

Even the thought that it might be enough is ridiculous.

But it is the funnest way to crack the nut!

What else to do during and after Duolingo, in orer to master a language, below.

## Duolingo _is_

### Paragon of _intuitive_

Duolingo does not have even the remotest resemblance of Introduction, Help or Tutorial.

You open it, and you know how it works, all the way through.

### Addictive

Duolingo is dangerously _addictive_.

You can get hooked on points, leagues, competition w/ friends; on the pure intellectual pleasure of learning and having learned.

### Fun

## Else

Many articles explain the obvious: Duolingo is _not_ enough to master a language.

### How to make a many points

What do you need points for?

* shamelessly boast w/ it (that's what I do)
* climb the leagues all the way up to the Diamond and get depressed there (ditto)

#### Use the app

The website gives less points and does not have all the features.

#### Rehearse

Rehearsing gives you, once a day per lesson, 20 XP.

#### Use boosters

There are two boosters, that double your points

1st

2nd

#### End of a lesson

The end of each lesson gives a lot of points.

Combining them w/ a booster gives you a huge gain.

#### Time

Of you want to make many points, you must spend time.

#### Voodoo

Some people make so many points, that the must have certainly sold their sould to the devil for it.
