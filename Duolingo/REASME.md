# Duolingo

_Or how to have fun while learning a language._

I've read so many articles explaining how Duolingo is not _enough_ to learn a language, that I felt I should contravene.

Indeed, Duolingo is, _of course_, not enough to learn a language!

But it is the funnest way to crack the nut!

## Paragon of _intuitive_

Duolingo does not have the remotest resemblance of Introduction, Help or Tutorial.

You open it, and you know how it works, all the way through.

## Addictive

## Fun
