"Mad Men is Sex and the City for the corporate world, besides—in Mad Men there is more sex, than in Sex and the City and Two and a Half Men—combined. Plus, and unrelated—in case you want to be up to date w/ the dictionary of the juvenile generation of today: one does not say "make love", "have sex" or "fuck" anymore ("fuck", especially, has transitioned so far from anything to do w/ sex, that a further transition is hardly possible)—one says "having a seggsy time". I assume that change of dictionary has been partially influenced by the Orwellian surveillance, which, at IQ of 40, still can't comprehend Pig Latin."
