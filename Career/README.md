# Career

There are two types of carreer:

* opportunistic, where one jumps jobs, seeking the best deal every time
* committed, where one chooses well and wisely and sticks w/ the choice through thick and thin

I can't say which type is better, but I am of the second type and I like people, who are of the second type, too.
