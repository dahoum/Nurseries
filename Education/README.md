# Education

## Historical Perspective

The schooling, the way we know it today, has roots as far back as the Dark Ages. Of the ideas to reform the Dark Ages approach to education, led by people like Comenius in the sixtheenth cenury, only some are implemented today. Which means that in parts, the modern education is based on the approach developed during the Dark Ages and has not been fully reformed since then.
