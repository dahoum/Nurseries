When the number of Senuir Staff grows, but the Company does not mature (grow in complexity and price) at the same speed, several things begin to happen:

* The salary pressure will hurt the financial health
* The competition for the few pieces of work, which deserve seniority will grow

Emergency measures to improve the health:

* Let steam/ blood, by letting Senior Staff go, to reduce the pressure.

Measure to stabilise:

* Have a long Junir Bench
* Have a healthy turnaround of seniors
  * Make it intentional and managed in the long term
* Have clear Roles and Positions, that have to be continuously earned and deserved
