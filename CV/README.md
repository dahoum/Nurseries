# CV

Applying via CV is a desperate act. It is justified only in three cases:

* early in your career
* in cases of very formal organisations
* later in your career, if you have failed to build a professional network

If a person w/ recruiting power tells you "Send me your CV", before even hacing spent a bit of time w/ you it means:

* You are one of many options, or
* They are not really into human relationships.
