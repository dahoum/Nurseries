# Kids and Talent

## 8+

If your kids have not shown a particular interst by age of 8, do not fret. Carlos Kleiber did not have a formal music education until age of 20, Van Gogh did not start painting until age of 28 and Hans Zimmer does not have any musical education at all.

But if they do show, you better support it.

It is not difficult and it can lead to lifelong passion and occupation.
