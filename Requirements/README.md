# Requirements

## "Obvious"

There is a tendency, when a projects fail expensively, for the requirements giver to say that certain requirement has been "obvious".

## Friendly

`Do Not Say` "This is not in the Requirements."

`Say Instead` "Hm... Can we check the Specification/ User Story? It might be that we have missed this Requirement."

* If you have, indeed, missed it: that's the best way to come out of this situation honest and friendly.
* If you have not, and it has, indeed, not been specified/ described: you come out clean and friendly at the same time.
