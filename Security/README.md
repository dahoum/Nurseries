# Security

## Personal

### Minimalist

The less software you have on your computer, the less bad things can happen to you.

### Password

A string login password protects you in more than one way.

### Screen Lock

Do not leave your computer unlocked.

It's not only security: someone may accidentally press a key and accidentally send this unfinished email or delete something.

### Screen Saver

For when you forget to lock your screen.

### Screen Protector

Reduce the visual angle from which the screen can be read.

### Wall Behind Your Back

Self-explanatory.

### Anti-Malware

Some OSes have a built-in one.

Sometimes hou should add.

### Encrypted HDD/ SSD

For when you lose your computer or it gets stolen.

### Backup w/ Infinite Versioning

For many reasons.

Ransomware is real.

### String Passeords

Passwords you do not need to write down are the best.

A way to remember such complex passwords is a simple set of rules. For example your favourite poem, where you get the first letter from the first word, the second letter from the second word, etc. You go like this for 12 words. If a letter is a first letter, it it a capital. If a word has less letters, you wrap from the beginning. At the end you add your age and an exclamation mark.
