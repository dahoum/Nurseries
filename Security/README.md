# Security

## Personal

### Minimalist

The less software you have on your computer, the less bad things can happen to you.

### Password

A string login password protects you in more than one way.

### Screen Lock

Do not leave your computer unlocked.

It's not only security: someone may accidentally press a key and accidentally send this unfinished email or delete something.

### Screen Saver

For when you forget to lock your screen.

### Screen Protector

Reduce the visual angle from which the screen can be read.

### Wall Behind Your Back

Self-explanatory.

### Anti-Malware

Some OSes have a built-in one.

Sometimes hou should add.

### Encrypted HDD/ SSD

For when you lose your computer or it gets stolen.

### Backup w/ Endless Versioning

For many reasons.

Ransomware is real.

## Organisational
