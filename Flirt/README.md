# Flirt

I am not going to teach you how to flirt w/ a girl (if you are a boy or a girl) or w/ a boy (if you are a girl or a boy). That's beyond the scope of my activities.

But I can teach you how to sell.

## Hello, I Love You

[![Hello, I Love You](https://img.youtube.com/vi/mTu1GQSyq4I/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mTu1GQSyq4I)

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She's walking down the street
Blind to every eye she meets
Do you think you'll be the guy
To make the queen of the angels sigh?
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name?
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game
She holds her head so high, like a statue in the sky
Her arms are wicked, and her legs are long
When she moves my brain screams out this song
Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
I want you, hello, I need my baby
Hello, hello, hello, hello
