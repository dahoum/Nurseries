# Agile

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) was in 2001. Before that, in 1996, was XP or Extreme Programming, which contained already some of the ideas. The Agile Manifesto consists of four lines, the first being

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Since then the amount of Agile methodologies, coaches and certifications has grown rapidly. To an extent, where the question should be asked: Is the original Agile dead? Or has it evolved to a point, where it should be renamed?

## Teaching Common Sense

There is another case, where something similar has happened and this is Design Thinking. Design Thinking begins w/ "empathy", which should be common sense. Not only in interpersonal relationships, but also (and especially) towards a customer. And still, it is taught. Why?

This [Article](https://medium.com/@cwodtke/five-habits-of-design-thinking-45bb61b30393) argues, that common sense is not enough to do Design Thinking. Design Thinking has always been common sense to me. May be because I am 750 years old. Which brings me to another thought: some atheists say, that moral is common sense, but if Design Thinking isn't, is moral really? Or perhaps we should ask: what is common sense actually? Is it something we are genetically born w/, or ratherâ€”collective+personal wisdom?
