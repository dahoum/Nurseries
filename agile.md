# Agile

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) was in 2001. Before that, in 1996, was XP or Extreme Programming, which contained already some of the ideas. The Agile Manifesto consists of four lines, the first being

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Since then the amount of Agile methodologies, coaches and certifications has grown rapidly. To an extent, where the question should be asked: Is the original Agile dead? Or has it evolved to a point, where it should be renamed?

## Teaching Common Sense

There is another case, where something similar has happened and this is Design Thinking. Design Thinking begins w/ "empathy", which should be common sense. Not only in interpersonal relationships, but also (and especially) towards a customer. And still, it is taught. Why?

This [Article](https://medium.com/@cwodtke/five-habits-of-design-thinking-45bb61b30393) argues, that common sense is not enough to do Design Thinking. Design Thinking has always been common sense to me. May be because I am 750 years old. Which brings me to another thought: some atheists say, that moral is common sense, but if Design Thinking isn't, is moral really? Or perhaps we should ask: what is common sense actually? Is it something we are genetically born w/, or ratherâ€”collective+personal wisdom?

My problem w/ [Common Sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense) is not that it should be taught. Being aquired, and not inherited, Common Sense should be taught and learned. My problem w/ Common Sense begins when it should be taught to people 25 and older. Teaching it to 12 years old is OK. So, my prelimnary conclusion is that the need to teach Common Sense to people 25 and older indicates a lack of teaching of Common Sense between age 12 and 25, which is, to me, a major miss in the current educational system.
