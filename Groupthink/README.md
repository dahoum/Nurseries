## Making Groups Smarter/ Wiser

### Silence the Leader

"Leaders often promote self-censorship by expressing their own views early, thus discouraging disagreement. Leaders and high-status members can do groups a big service by indicating a willingness and a desire to hear uniquely held information. They can also refuse to take a firm position at the outset and in that way make space for more information to emerge. Many studies have found that members of low-status groups—including less-educated people, African-Americans, and sometimes women—have less influence within deliberating groups (and may self-silence). Leaders who model an open mind and ask for candid opinions can reduce this problem." <sup>[1](#1)</sup>

## Origin

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_H._Whyte

"In 1952, Whyte coined the term "Groupthink":"

> Groupthink being a coinage – and, admittedly, a loaded one – a working definition is in order. We are not talking about mere instinctive conformity – it is, after all, a perennial failing of mankind. What we are talking about is a rationalized conformity – an open, articulate philosophy which holds that group values are not only expedient but right and good as well <sup>[2](#2)</sup>

## Irving Janis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irving_Janis

"Groupthink describes the tendency of groups to try to minimize conflict and reach consensus without sufficiently testing, analyzing, and evaluating their ideas."

"His work suggested that pressures for conformity restrict the thinking of the group, bias its analysis, promote simplistic and stereotyped thinking, and stifle individual creative and independent thought."
