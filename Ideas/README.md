Oh, you do not need to tell me about ideas. Ideas are like boys who fall in love w/ the same girl, all at the same time. Who has it first, who makes it first and who wins—are all three different things. And what "win" means—an entirely another story. What I am sure about this idea, that without some really open Wikipedia/ Greenpeace kind of model for data collection and control, it would not work.
