# Coop

## Introduction and Motivation

To decide something alone is difficult. To have two people agree on something, more difficult. A group, nearly impossible. And yet, people do it. From Kindergärten, through schools, to business and large research organisations—the cooperative form is viable and potent. Interestingly, as the Harvard's professor Michael Sandel demonstrates in his course Justice: The Moral Side of Murder (https://youtu.be/kBdfcR-8hEY), the larger the cooperative and the more distant the action from the result—the easier it gets to criticise—eg. people tend to criticise the government as if they do it better, but then ask them to decide where they go on holiday and, oh, boy! Anyway—wanting to challenge myself w/ the cooperative form of thinking, I doing an applied research project, which has the intention to study the possibility of creating a cooperative w/ focus, initially, on research and prototyping in the area of digital products. I am looking for like-minded people, so if curious or interested: ping me.

## Executive Summary

This is a research into cooperative forms of business organisation in the areas of Innovation Driven Services (Research & Development, Prototyping).

If the ideas gets traction, they will be realised.

The research and ideas try to solve a number of problems related to in-house and outsourced Innovation Driven Services.

## Audience

This document is written for individuals and representatives of organisations who are interested in exploring the possibility of taking one of the following roles in the Cooperative`

### Co-Founders

The Co-Founders of the Cooperative are the Founding Members.

They have no special rights compared to the Members who join later, except under the [Precedence](#precedence) Rule.

### Members

All `Customers` and `Employees` can be `Members` of the `Cooperative`.

Not only _can_, but probably _must_, w/in reason.

So, a rule will be probably devised, under which all Customers and Employees must be Members, allowing for some exceptions, where mandatory membership is not practical and membership can be optional.

### Customers

Customers of the Cooperative can be individuals and organisations, who purchase services from the Cooperative.

A key difference the Cooperative offers, compared to the normal, market based dealings 

### Employees

The `Employees` of the `Cooperative` may be voting `Members`.

It is desirable, that a meaningful proportion of the `Employees` of the `Cooperative` are voting `Members`, in order to make the Cooperative a viable democratic organisation and differentiate it from regular employment. 

Thus, the `Cooperative` is best suited for professionals, who desire more freedom and control, than a regular employment, and at the same time less responsibility, than a true partnership in a venture.

### Strategic Partners

## Research & Development Cooperative

### Which Problems Are We Solving?

#### Need of Qualified and Dedicated, but Fluctuating Quantity of Expertise

Some small and medium size companies have variable need for expertise over time.

They can profit from a larger partners, who can offer a rich selection.

#### Uncertainty Through Dependency w/o Control

A supplier-customer relationship, even when excellent both contractually and in tems of human relatios, does not solve the problem, that these are two separate legal entities and the customer has zero influence over the ownership and governance of the supplier.

This creates uncertainty throuh dependency and can be an obstacle in the way of a deeper and longer partnership.

This challenge can be addressed through exchange of shares, however this is either too weak or too strong. Too few shares do not give enough control and too many shares are practically a takeover. The interests of other customers are not protected as shareholders have the right of information or the interests of other customers can be overruled, which destroys the value of a broader organisation.

A cooperative form can give participation in the governance through voting rights to the customer, while leaving the cooperative fully independent in pursuing its main goals.

The broad base of the cooperative, thus, benefits all participants.

A well functioning example is Fraunhofer e.V.

#### Knowledge Workers Are The Capital And Deserve A Structural Vote

The premise of this idea is, that running a body shop of knowledge workers is not the right way knowledge workers should operate.

The Agile Manifesto, published in 2001, pleades, above all, for greater involvement of the knowledge workers into the process.

A Research & Development cooperative, where the accumulated capital is owned by all cooperative members (see the [Precedence](#precedence) rule), is a more fair approach, than one or a few individuals owning the result of the worl of everybody, because they started the company in the past and this gives them gradually a larger and larger leverage compared to everybody else.

### Vision

A cooperative w/ focus on IT Research and Development.

Members can be individuals and organisations who need Research and Development or who want to work for the cooperative.

Each member has one vote.

The Vision and the cooperative cannot be changed by members voting to change it.

The cooperative is financed by customers who order `IT Research and Development` work.

(Can replicate Fraunhofer, but on another level.)

### Membershup

Members can be

* Customers as long as they have a contract
* Employees
* Subcontractors
* Partners
  * Strategic
  * Cooperation
  * Research

### Ownership

#### Name

The `Cooperative` owns the name.

#### Ideas

All Ideas developed inside the cooperative are owned by the cooperative.

Exception are ideas, developed on order by a customer.

To all Ideas applies the [Precedence](#precedence) rule.

### Budget

The cooperative has very clear and transparent roles and salary structure, that follows the salary structure of similar establishments (eg. Universities, Fraunhofer, TNO, etc.)

The cooprative has a minimalistic overhead (as minimalistic as possible).

Fixed %s from the overal turnover go into

* PR and sales effort
* Training of the employees
* Idle Fund
* Budget for own Research and Development Projects

#### Salaries

The cooperative pays salaries following the salary structure of similar organisations:

* Universities
* Fraunhofer

##### Salary as Talant Attraction And Retention

The premise, that talent is attracted by pay is wrong.

The most powerful driving force is the possibility to control one's destiny.

By giving employees equal vote (and not only on organisational level, but w/in every sub-organisational level, one grants them the ultimate gift in life.

### Principles

#### Purpose and Quality

The `Purpose` and `Qualaity` are clearly defined and the main guidance.

* prototyping services

#### Roles/ Freedom and Flexibility

The `Cooperative` is governed by clearly defined roles w/ clear responsibilities.

#### Initiatives

An `Initiative` is a short, medium or long term projects, which can be initiatied by any Member of the Cooperative.

The Initiatives are the core internal innovation mechanism.

A strict set of rules guarantees, that:

* everyone can start an initiative
* nobody can stop a successful initiative, which abides by the rules of the cooperative

##### Rules Supporting Initiatives

* The pricing, earning and salary structure of the cooperative is such, that every employee has 20% of their working time for personal growth, education, training, development of ideas and launch of initiatives.
* Initiatives born through this 20% rule, can seek internal and external adopters and customers.
* Initiatives, that attract intrnal or external adopters and customers can grow. For example a person w/ idea can attract second or more persons who contribute their 20% budget to the idea.
* Initiatives are subject to the [Precedence](#precedence) rule.

##### Budget

An `Initiative` has own budget. Each `Initiative` has the right of a proportion of the shared internal R&D budget and can attract external budget.

##### Freedom of Design and Leadership of Initiatives

To promote and support initiative, members can design and lead initiatives.

#### Protection and Preservation of Initiatives

The `Cooperative` cannot stop `Initiatives`, which are viable, where viability is defined as earning its own money, or financing its existance through means of support by other cooperative members, reducing one's pay.

### Governance

#### Staying on Course

One of the major fears, when it comes to democratic models (like a democratic country, in fact) is that a bad majority can take the organisation off course.

This is, indeed, a real danger. However it is not a greater danger, than the organisation being take off course, by a small clique at the top.

A democratic process might be slower and might prevent peaks of ingenuinity (which is actually not true, see the section on [Initiatives](#initiatives)), but it leads to greater overall social wealth, which leads to creater overall hapiness.

The same way democratic countries stay on course w/ the help of a constinution, the Cooperative can stay on course w/ the help of clearly defined vision, mission, rukes of governance and KPIs; all described in this document.

#### Challenges and Dangers

##### Founder's Syndrome

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder%27s_syndrome

Founder's syndrome is an issue organizations experience as they expand. Dynamic founders, who have a strong vision of how to operate the project, try to retain control of the organization, even as new employees or volunteers want to expand the project's scope or change policy.

##### Peter's Principle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle

The Peter Principle is a concept in management developed by Laurence J. Peter, which observes that people in a hierarchy tend to rise to their "level of incompetence": employees are promoted based on their success in previous jobs until they reach a level at which they are no longer competent, as skills in one job do not necessarily translate to another.

##### Hostile Takeover

...

### Precedence

The Precedence Rule is a key and a complex rule w/ several goals:

* protection of work and ideas of earlier members from hostile takeover by members, who have joined later
* formexample the founders of the cooperative have precedence and the people who have concieved an idea have precedence

The complexity of the Precedence Rule is that it should not create legacy structures, which hinder progress, as these can lead to the death of the creativity and of the organisation altogether.

Thus, the Precedence Rule should only apply to own ideas, should not give blocking power over new ideas and their initiation and realisation. Such Rules are called Balancing Rules.

All new peoposals are given to eimployees, initiatives and partners in order of precedence, who have first right of refusal.
