# Maturity

Maturity of a person, crew, process or (digital) product is an important indicator when a decision related to ther management is taken.

Applying a fully matured process onto an immature (but passionate, capable and focused—thus—successful) crew, can in some cases lead to loss of motivaton and should be done w/ care.

People, who believe in certain level of maturity of processes, and who are eager to apply them, w/o regard as to the maturity of the subject or object, could cause losses and should be observed and advised.
