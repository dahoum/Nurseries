# Project Checklist

This project checklist is based on my experience. This includes my personal mistakes and successes, for which I have paid in blood, not so much sweat, but many tears, as well as what I have learned from my favourite sources: works of literature, musical condcutors, film producers and directors. I rarely learn from business when when I do, then mostly about bravery, perseverence and survival; not method.

## Sponsor

The most important things about a project isâ€”

* who is the driving spirit/idea
* who gives the money

## Scope

### Scope

### Assumptions

Defining assumptions and out-of-Scope is critical for survival.

### Out-of-Scope

Defining out-of-scope and assumptions is critical for survival.

## Estimation

Estimating is an art, that's why there is a separate document on [estimation](estimation.md).

## Key Milestones and Deadlines

### Daily Milestones and Deadlines

Setting the project level milestones and deadlines 

## Risks

### People

#### Unsuitable Crew Members

#### Loss of Key Crew Members

Identifying the key crew members is an art.

A key crew member does not necessarily need to be a productive direct contributor to the project goal.

Secondary contributions such a supporting crew members and supporting the spirit of the project are as important for success.
