# Email

Pronounced as dead, email is more alive and powerful, than ever.

## General Recommendations

* one topic per email
  * unless the topics are related, but
  * still keep them separate if a topic has special significance or requires special attention, and
  * in case more than one topic, do number them: makes referencing them in replies easier
* write full sentences w/ all detail
  * write "at 15:00 CET on Monday" not Monday afternoon

## Coordination

Email can be a powerful tool to coordinate, when used well.

* describe concisely what you are coordinating
* list any points, options and open questions as numbers, so that they can be easily referenced in replies
  * when smaller number of points you can give them names like "travel", "accomodation"
* after a  umber of replies, resummarise everying, keeping the thread 

## Status

Email is a powerful status update tool.

* easy threading
* easy to add/ remove recipients

Recommendations

* keep milestones, deadlines and key agreements as some sort of permanent paragraph
  * people tend to get distracted and forget: repetitions remind and help remember, plus
  * repetitions inspire thinking and people may notice issues and raise flags
