# Diary

## Project

The `Project Diary` is simple a powerful too w/o cost.

It is independent the rest of the `Project Documents` and `Project Tools`.

Many thanks to my friend and a brilliant project manager [Nav Wik](http://linkedin.com/in/navwic) for teaching me about _focus points_ (the hard way, due to my resistance to change).

Example:

### 21 July

Governance and Crew

_Here are listed all roles, the people in them and current facts about this person (eg. has work, does not have work, on holiday, sick, will leave the project, etc.)_

* `Role` `Person` _facts_ 
* `Role` `Person` _facts_
