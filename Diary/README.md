# Diary

## Project

The `Project Diary` is one of the simples and most powerful instruments. On 1/2 a page (for projects involving between 1 and 12/24 people) it informs everybody:

* Who is responsible for what _today_?
* What is the general situation around each person?
* Who will be focusing on what today?
* What was achieved?

It is a summary instrument and does _not_ replace, and should not duplicate any instrument, though a skilled person w/ a good crew can manage complex projects w/ a diary only.

Many thanks to my friend and a brilliant project manager [Nav Wik](http://linkedin.com/in/navwic) for teaching me about _focus points_ (the hard way, due to my resistance to change).
