## James Barry

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Barry_(surgeon)

James Barry(c. 1789–25 July 1865) was a military surgeon in the British Army, born in Cork, Ireland.

Barry obtained a medical degree from the University of Edinburgh Medical School, then served first in Cape Town, South Africa, and subsequently in many parts of the British Empire. Before retirement, Barry had risen to the rank of Inspector General (equivalent to Brigadier General) in charge of military hospitals, the second highest medical office in the British Army. Barry not only improved conditions for wounded soldiers, but also the conditions of the native inhabitants, and performed the first recorded caesarean section by a European in Africa in which both the mother and child survived the operation.

Although Barry's entire adult life was lived as a man, Barry was named Margaret Ann Bulkley[8] at birth and was known as female in childhood. Barry lived as a man in both public and private life, at least in part in order to be accepted as a university student and pursue a career as a surgeon, with Barry's birth sex only becoming known to the public and to military colleagues after a post-mortem examination.
