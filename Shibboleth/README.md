# Shibboleth

You like Israel, but you are not sure if your colleague likes Israel. You do not care about Israel more, than you care about any other country, but you find the sufferings of the Palestinian people not on par w/ the 21st centuryâ€”but you are not sure if your colleague shares this opinion. Speaking w/ your collegue about anything, that is potentially dividing, where you can find yourself in a disadvantegeous position, not to mention a position in which you receive bullying or abuse, is challenging.

There are ways how to probe the water, before you get into more direct conversation.

These ways are symbolised by Shibboleth
