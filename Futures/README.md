Futures Studies

I like the plural: "futures". There are many possible futures. Which one will exactly happen, we do not know.

Here I keep my views on the Futures.

They are all my oroginal ideas. I may and for sure have been inspired to have them, by facts, events, people and ideas. I may have even encountered them and then forgotten the encounter, thinking they are mine. So, in my honest opinion, they are mine, until I realise it is otherwise.

## Computing

### Truly Serverless

`Serverless Computing` has been a fact for a while, though it is still bound to a specific provider.

In the future there will be `Serverless Computing` detached from the provider. All providers will be a pool and our logic will execute on the most suitable.

This already exists in the cases of energy distribution or ISP. Our ISP is only the gateway, where the Internet flows after that is not our concern.

Truly Serverless will apply to our own Logic, but also to freely available Logic (free to use or pay to use, this is irellevant).

## Data

In the future `Data` will be `Serverless` and `Wrapped in Logic`.

#### Serverless

`Serverless Computing` has been a fact for a while.

In the future we will have `Serverless Data`. This will require the `Data` to be `Wrapped in Logic`.

#### Wrapped in Logic

In future every piece of data will be `Wrapped in Logic`.

```
+---------------+
|               |
| Logic Wrapper |
|               |
| +------+      |
| |      |      |
| | Data |      |
| |      |      |
| +------+      |
+---------------|
```

The `Logic Wrapper` will be responsible for the ownership, privacy, security, transport and interraction w/ other pieces of data, logic, devices and people.

#### Queried

We will not query data the way we do now, but we will send `requests` and `messages` into the aether.

These `requests` and `messages` will be intersepted by the `Logic Wrapper`, which will or will not act on them, depending on the identity of the `Requester`, etc.

Respectively, some `Logic Wrappers` will be context aware. For example the `Logic Wrapper` around the `day of birth` will know whose `day of birth` this is and will know how to find the `month of birth` and `year of birth` if requested.

#### Processed

Then there will be `Logic w/o Data`. This will be `Higher Order of Logic`. For example `birth` will be one such logic, which is aware of all aspects of birth:

* date
* place
* parents, etc.

We can ask this logic a more general question and it will, in turn, assemble the answer.

Needless to say, this `Logic` will be [Trully Serverless](#truly-serverless).

## IT

I believe, that the IT will have the same fate like the nuclear energy.

IT has the chance to prove itself as useful and secure.

Iseful it is, secure: not so much.

So far the security breaches have affected the "rich and powerful" (banks, etc.), so the ordinary person does not feel directly affected.

However time will come (rather `when` not `if`), when the ordinary person will be affected.

We already lost airplanes due to software error.

What hasn't happen so far is large scale disaster w/ loss of life, clearly due to IT error.

Then things will change.
