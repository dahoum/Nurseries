Futures Studies

I like the plural: "futures". There are many possible futures. Which one will exactly happen, we do not know.

Here I keep my views on the Futures.

They are all my oroginal ideas. I may and for sure have been inspired to have them, by facts, events, people and ideas. I may have even encountered them and then forgotten the encounter, thinking they are mine. So, in my honest opinion, they are mine, until I realise it is otherwise.

## Data

In the future `Data` will be `Serverless` and `Wrapped in Logic`.

### Serverless

### Wrapped in Logic

IIn future every piece of data will be `Wrapped in Logic`.

The  which will be responsible for its ownership,  privacy, security, transport and interraction w/ other pieces of data, logic, devices and people.

We will notmquery data the way we do now, but we will "shout", sending "messages" and "questions" and the logic, wrapped around the data, data will "answer".

Respectively some data logic will be context aware. For example the logic wrapping the day of birth will know that there is month and year of birth.

Then there will be logic w/o data. For example `birth` will be one such logic, which is aware of all aspects of birth: date, place, parents, etc. We can ask this logic a more general question and it will, in turn, assemble the answer, provided we have the right to access it.

## IT

I believe, that the IT will have the same fate like the nuclear energy.

IT has the chance to prove itself as useful and secure.

Iseful it is, secure: not so much.

So far the security breaches have affected the "rich and powerful" (banks, etc.), so the ordinary person does not feel directly affected.

However time will come (rather `when` not `if`), when the ordinary person will be affected.

We already lost airplanes due to software error.

What hasn't happen so far is large scale disaster w/ loss of life, clearly due to IT error.

Then things will change.
