## Mad Men

"When I see hype, I go the other way. Then I'm waiting for it to cool down. Unless I catch it before it has happened. For example I read Harr Potter early in 2008 and though it was OK. So I'm finally binge catching up on Mad Men. If you are in agency business, and you have not seen it yetâ€”watch it. Especially if you are an annoying Account Manager. Excuse my French."
