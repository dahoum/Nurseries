# Domain

## Represent w/ a Variable/ Tag

Represent the domain w/ a variable/ tag everywhere:

* in the software
* in the translation/ localisation
* in templates

Take the variable/ tag value from a central place, which is aware of the environment (eg. production/ live, stage/ acceptance, etc.)

> else you may end up in a sitiation, where the production/ live site or messages it sends (emails, etc.) lead to the wrong URL.
