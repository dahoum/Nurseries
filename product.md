# (Digital) Product

Digital product is a product like any product. The difference is that in its core there is software. And that this software is surrounded by a surounding specific to digital products.

## Ideation

As w/ any product, the digital products begin in two major ways. In practice they are usually interwoven. Observing them separately helps the understanding.

### Idea First

The Idea First beginning starts w/ an idea, which later is implemented, partially or fully, in software.

### Technology First

The Technology First beginning strts w/ a a technological innovation, which later becomes a base for an idea or is matched to a problem.

We say technology, because digital products are in fact not only software, and applications, that become possible in software, are frequently underpinned by progress in hardware, which enables the software to do certain things.

## Development

Digital products are usually developed through [projects](project.md), which can be less or more formal.
