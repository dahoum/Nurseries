# 7-38-55

7-38-55 is a `metaphor` that the total impression is based on 7% what is said, 38% how is said and 55% body language.

The concept has been brought up by Albert Mehrabian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Mehrabian).

While its scientificity is disputed, and the actual distribution (if any) depends based on person and situation, the Gedankenexperiment is worth a consideration.
