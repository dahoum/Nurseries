# Collection

This is a collection of thoughts and experiences to help me remember and remind me. And be useful for others, should they find it so. This collection is the guide for the crews in all projects I lead.

## Inspiration

The collection is based on my experience. This includes my personal mistakes and successes, for which I have paid in blood, not so much sweat, but many tears, as well as what I have learned from my favourite sources: works of literature, musical condcutors, film producers and directors. I rarely learn from business when when I do, then mostly about bravery, perseverence and survival; not method.

I am not a quote hunter. What other people have said mostly confirms my own thoughts. See above. I learn from business mostly about bravery. So, if I may use one quote, to underline this intellectual effort, it will be this one:

> “When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.”
