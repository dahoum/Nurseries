# Nurseries

Nurseries is a collection of notes related to the "nurseries" part of the "[talent scouting](https://github.com/dahoum/TalentScouting/blob/main/Talent.md) & nurseries" label I have chosen to denote what I do professionally.

John le Carré calls, in his books, the MI6 training centre—"the nursery".

Nurseries contains thoughts, [Practices](https://github.com/dahoum/Nurseries/tree/master/Practices), individuals and ventures.

I use Nurseries as a source of reminders and inspiration to:

* develop talent
* help the establishment and controlling of Practices
* help structuring startups and scale ups as well as restructuring organisations

## Inspiration

The collection is based on my experience. It includes my personal mistakes and successes, for which I have paid in tears, as well as what I have learned works of literature, musical condcutors, film producers and directors. I rarely learn from business when when I do, then mostly about bravery, perseverence and survival; seldom method.

My experience is only the frame of reference. My experience would have been impossible w/o all those, whom I have worked for or w/. This experience belongs to them as much as to me. Not only because they have shed their portion of blood, sweat and tears. But because much if not all of the learning has happened w/in the interaction w/ them.

If I may use one quote, to underline this intellectual effort, it will be this one:

> “When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.”
