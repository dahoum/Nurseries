# Collection

This is a collection of thoughts and experiences to help me remember and remind me. And be useful for others, should they find it so. This collection is the guide for the crews in the projects I lead.

The collection is based on my experience. This includes my personal mistakes and successes, for which I have paid in blood, not so much sweat, but many tears, as well as what I have learned from my favourite sources: works of literature, musical condcutors, film producers and directors. I rarely learn from business when when I do, then mostly about bravery, perseverence and survival; not method.
