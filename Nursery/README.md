## Periods/ Modus Operandi

In my work w/ talent there are two periods or moduis operandi.

The first is after I discover the talent and before they begin to believe in it it, before they decide they want to pursue it and before they become not only ready to make the effort, but actually making it. During this period I pull and they get pulled. I convince, and they doubt.

At some point an `inflection point` is reached by those, who can, want and do; where they begin to pull and I begin to guide from behind.
