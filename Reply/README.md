[People Who Brag About Being in Back-to-Back Meetings Deeply Misunderstand Productivity](https://medium.com/curious/people-who-brag-about-being-in-back-to-back-meetings-deeply-misunderstand-productivity-ed00701d3f69)

My take:

* Absolutely! I teach managers, that they MUST have free time, so that they are available for their crew, their peers and those they report to. Also that hourglass full of gold dust. The moment you receive communication, the gold dust begins to flow, initially very fast, then slower. Once you reply, you can collect what's left in the upper chamber. The more you wait, the less gold dust is left for you. The faster you reply, the more you get.
* Excellent article! Busy can mean two things: 1. The topic does not motivate you or it is not important for you (see the Motivation and Importance diagram, it's v interesting: [Motivation](../Motivation/README.md)). In that case, say it honestly, do not waste people's time. 2. You have a whole lot of problems w/ focus, time management and delegation. EDIT/PS Or as Jack Welch nicely put it: "If you cannot do the job in 8 hours /or less/, you are not good for that job."
