"Absolutely! I teach managers, that they MUST have free time, so that they are available for their crew, their peers and those they report to. Also that hourglass full of gold dust. The moment you receive communication, the gold dust begins to flow, initially very fast, then slower. Once you reply, you can collect what's left in the upper chamber. The more you wait, the less gold dust is left for you. The faster you reply, the more you get."
