## Account Manager

"You've been pitching more to me than you have to clients."

"What does that mean?"

"It means you've been selling their ideas to me more than mine to them."

"I wish you would handle the clients as well as you're handling me."

Don Draper to Pete Campbell, Mad Men, 6/3 23:40

Weak Account Managers pressure their own organisations instead of selling.
