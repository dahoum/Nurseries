## Account Manager

"You've been pitching more to me than you have to clients."

"What does that mean?"

"It means you've been selling their ideas to me more than mine to them."

Mad Men, 2/6 23:60

Weak, incompetent, cowardly, but arrogant and merciless Account Managers, hide their weakness, incompetence and cowardness by pressuring their own organisationâ€”instead of selling.

If you you are a CEO or another kind of manager, responsible on Account Managers, warch for this behaviour. It can destroy your organisation.

If you are their peer or work for them, and their superiors do not deal w/ it: you are in very bad of luck indeed. Run.

If you are an Account Manager, and you are honest, and you feel you give in to external pressure and compensate by transferring it to your organisation, in a way, which is not honest: you need help. And it is infinitely more honourable to ask for help at that very moment.
