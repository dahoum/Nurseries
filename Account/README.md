## Account Manager

"You've been pitching more to me than you have to clients."

"What does that mean?"

"It means you've been selling their ideas to me more than mine to them."

Mad Men, 2/6 23:60

Weak, incompetent, cowardly, but arrogant and merciless Account Managers, hide their weakness, incompetence and cowardness by pressuring their own organisationâ€”instead of selling.

If you you are a CEO or another kind of manager, responsible on Account Managers, warch for this behaviour. It can destroy your organisation.

If you are their peer or work for them, and their superiors do not deal w/ it: you are in very bad of luck indeed. Run.
