# Agile

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) was in 2001. Before that, in 1996, was XP or Extreme Programming, which contained already some of the ideas. The Agile Manifesto consists of four lines, the first being

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Since then the amount of Agile methodologies, coaches and certifications has grown rapidly. To an extent, where the question should be asked: Is the original Agile dead? Or has it evolved to a point, where it should be renamed?

## Agile is Faster and Cheapter than Waterfall, for the same scope

SELL ME THIS PEN For the same scope and quality, Agile delivers faster and cheaper than Waterfall. I am T. E. Shaw, and I can tell you why.

One of the reasons why Agile is faster and cheaper than Waterfall—for the same scope, is that it allows nearly zero possibility for people to hide behind bureaucracy.

Details—

A couple of years ago I was helping a company to fix productivity and discovered, that their three departments were busy chasing their own tails, writing emails, creating tickets and comments in their separate ticketing systems, w/ overall result—zero.

"Individuals and Interactions", the first three words of the Agile Manifesto, tear down these walls and remove the possibilities to hide, improving productivity dramatically and reducing risk.

I have not heard of anybody else to has applied 20/80 Pareto onto the Agile Manifesto—I did apply it. The Manifesto is 4 lines. If you take the 1st line you have 25% of it, so if you do "Individuals and Interactions" correctly, you should have successfully implemented more than 80% of Agile.

## Teaching Common Sense

There is another case, where something similar has happened and this is Design Thinking. Design Thinking begins w/ "empathy", which should be common sense. Not only in interpersonal relationships, but also (and especially) towards a customer. And still, it is taught. Why?

This [Article](https://medium.com/@cwodtke/five-habits-of-design-thinking-45bb61b30393) argues, that common sense is not enough to do Design Thinking. Design Thinking has always been common sense to me. May be because I am 750 years old. Which brings me to another thought: some atheists say, that moral is common sense, but if Design Thinking isn't, is moral really? Or perhaps we should ask: what is common sense actually? Is it something we are genetically born w/, or rather—collective+personal wisdom?

My problem w/ [Common Sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense) is not that it should be taught. Being aquired, and not inherited, Common Sense should be taught and learned. My problem w/ Common Sense begins when it should be taught to people 25 and older. Teaching it to 12 years old is OK. So, my prelimnary conclusion is that the need to teach Common Sense to people 25 and older indicates a lack of teaching of Common Sense between age 12 and 25, which is, to me, a major miss in the current educational system.
