# Quality

## Begins

Quality begins before even the person has been born or the organisation, product or service thought up.

Why else do we proudly have Made in Germany and Swiss Made? German cars. Swiss watches. French parfume.

## Ends

Quality ends long after the person has died or the organisation  product or service ceased to exist.

Qality people, organisations, products and services may become a legend.

## Control Framework

A reliable way of implementing initial quality, which is then gradually enhqnced, is with the help of a Control Framework.

A Control Framework is a set of Controls. Each control has a Name, a Description, a Way of Implementation/ Execution, possibly supported by tools such as Checklists, a Responsible Person, a Frequency, Result from the last check and Recommendations/ TODOs to be fulfilled intil a specific milestones, deadline.
