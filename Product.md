# (Digital) Product

`Digital Product` is a product like any `Product`.

The difference between a `Digital Product` a `Non-Digital Product` is that the core of a `Digital Product` is `software`.

Thus a `Digital Product` is developed, delivered, supported and maintained following the laws and practices of `software`.

## Ideation

As w/ `Non-Digital Products`, the `Digital Products` begin in two major ways. In practice they are usually interwoven. Observing them separately helps the understanding.

### Idea First

The Idea First beginning starts w/ an idea, which later is implemented, partially or fully, in software.

### Software First

The Software First way begins w/ a software innovation, which later becomes a base for an idea or is matched to a problem.

We say technology, because digital products are in fact not only software, and applications, that become possible in software, are frequently underpinned by progress in hardware, which enables the software to do certain things.

## Pre-Engineering

The `Pre-Engineering` phase is v important for low cost of `Engineering`. It is far cheaper to do mockups on paper or in a simple tool, than to fix `Eingineering`.

### Wireframes

#### Explain Wireframes

The `Wireframes Shock` is a surprise when visually inclined `Sponsor` sees black and white lines.

## Development

Digital products are usually developed through [projects](project.md), which can be less or more formal.
